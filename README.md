Q-Learning Assignment (Python)
This project implements a Q-learning–based reinforcement learning model as part of a course assignment.
The goal is to apply Q-learning to an economic decision-making problem, where agents learn optimal strategies through repeated interactions with the environment.

Overview
1. Uses Q-learning to learn optimal decisions
2. Discrete action space
3. Reward defined by profit / payoff
4. Iterative learning through episodes
5. Focus on understanding learning dynamics, not performance optimization

Key Concepts
1. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
2. Q-learning
3. State–Action value function (Q-table)
4. Exploration vs. exploitation (ε-greedy)
5. Reward-based learning

Requirements
Python 3.x

Required packages:
numpy
